# GNN
Using GNN on Surface Code

#Model 
- Load the dataset (torch*.pt), the construct of the network and also training/val.

#New_datacreator
-Loads data from MCMC-run and create the wanted data ( edge_list, node_labels etc..)

#Convert_data_pytorch
-Convert our edge_list, node labels etc to the object Data() (torch_test.pt) which is used in pytorch geometric.
